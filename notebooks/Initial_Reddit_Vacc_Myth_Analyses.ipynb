      "Do not give a platform for anti-vaxxers to propagate. I am of the mind to report social media groups that identify as anti-vaxxers as dangerous and miss-leading. Whether it’s a YouTube video or a Facebook Page, etc. My thinking is that such groups simply become more and more influential through confirmation bias and thus promote more people towards dangerous actions. When you visit these groups the degree of critical thinking and criticism drops because every statement no matter how ridiculous reinforces the same misleading theme that vaccines are bad. So now the claims are not just vaccines cause autism, it’s vaccines cause cancer, diabetes, Down syndrome, depression, genetic mutations, and so forth. And yes I have read all these ridiculous claims made by anti-vaxxers. The evolving implied insanity is becoming that vaccines cause disease! My thought is that these anti-vaxxers do not deserve a social media platform to further nurture their growing ignorance. I encourage everyone to report all anti-vaxxers social media groups as ‘misleading’ and ‘potentials dangerous.’ Because there actions affect us, not just them!\n",

      "Lol. These are quotes from the studies. And the studies are trying to figure out why the flu vaccine causes this decrease in efficacy. Feel free to read them and let me know your interpretation. As far as group immunity...Note the “no decline in transmission” below According to a Cochrane review the flu vaccine IF it has the correct strains circulating reduces the likelihood of catching the flu from 4% if unvaccinated to 1% if vaccinated. A 3% risk difference. So not much of a benefit there. Also the study concluded that there is no evidence that the flu vaccine affect complications, such as pneumonia, or transmission. The CDC combines pneumonia rates with flu rates to estimate the number of deaths from the flu, creating extremely exaggerated numbers to push the flu vaccine when the flu vaccine doesn’t reduce rates of pneumonia. And the insert actually lists pneumonia as a possible side effect. Cochrane reviewhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22895945/And...The Myth of Herd ImmunityThe Myth of Herd Immunity leads us to believe that unvaccinated populations will bring back epidemics of deadly diseases. This myth also makes us believe that:1. Unvaccinated children are a threat to society and2. Unvaccinated children pose a risk to vaccinated children.I’ll tackle this whole discombobulated mess of a myth in one post, through the research, knowledge, science, & expertise of a doctor, a pediatrician, & a neurosurgeon.What are we told?* We often hear statements from public health officials like “Clusters of unvaccinated children are not only in potential danger themselves, but are also a threat to the herd immunity”.* Authorities argue that parents should vaccinate their children to protect society as a whole from epidemics.* According to public health officials, “parents who reject vaccines don’t consider the effect of their child on the rest of society”.* We are told that for the shots to work, everyone must play along. And parents who decline the vaccines, are somehow reaping the benefits from those who are vaccinated.What is truth? Dr. O’Shea, in his book: “Vaccination is Not Immunization” explains:  “Do not make the error of many pediatricians or journalists who talk about herd immunity as though it refers to the immunity that proceeds from a large group of people being vaccinated. The calculated deception behind this common misnomer is that if you don’t know what herd immunity is, you’ll buy their illusion: that the unvaccinated child can take advantage of the herd who have been vaccinated. This is well though-out propaganda. True herd immunity is a term which indicates that a disease has burned itself out within a population, as with plague, smallpox, typhus-every infectious disease in history. The herd has become immune. Natural selection. It has to do with nature, not with manmade vaccines. Don’t be fooled again”Dr. Palevsky (board-certified pediatrician) explains: “This whole concept of herd immunity is very interesting, because we were taught that herd immunity occurs because a certain percentage of a population gets an active illness. Therefore by a certain percentage of getting the active illness, they impart a protection onto the remaining part of the population that has not gotten the illness yet. And so the herd that is getting the illness is shedding the illness and protecting those who have not gotten it.\"In vaccine science, we are extrapolating or concluding that if we vaccinate a certain percentage of people, we are imparting protection on those who have not been vaccinated. And that has NOT been shown to be true, because the true herd immunity in theory is based on an ACTIVE DISEASE, and we know that despite what we’re taught, vaccination does not mimic the natural disease.Thus, we cannot use the same model of herd immunity in a natural disease in the vaccination policy. This does not stop the press, every single year.The entire concept of herd immunity fails to acknowledge that there is a life cycle of the viruses and the bacteria all on their own, and that what turns them on and off may have nothing to do with the percentage of people who have been infected.By failing to include that viruses have a life cycle, and that they are in relationship to other organisms and to us, we are missing the main point. It is preposterous to think that a child who is vaccinated no longer carries the bacteria or the viruses that they have been vaccinated against. That is the whole point of vaccines.So Once You Are Vaccinated, You Are Part of the Herd. Right?Dr. Blaylock (board certified neurosurgeon) explains: “In the original description of herd immunity, the protection to the population at large occurred only if people contracted the infections naturally. The reason is that naturally acquired immunity lasts for a lifetime. Vaccine proponents quickly latched onto this concept and applied it to vaccine-induced immunity. But there was one major problem: Vaccine-induced immunity lasts for only a relatively short period…This is why they quietly began to suggest  boosters for most vaccines, even the common childhood infections such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella.Then they discovered an even greater problem: The boosters were lasting for only two years or less. This is why we are now seeing mandates that youth entering colleges have multiple vaccines, even those that they insisted gave lifelong immunity, such as the MMR. The same is being suggested for full-grown adults. Ironically, no one in the media or medical field is asking what is going on. They just accept that it must be done.That vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. We all were told for over 70 years that vaccine immunity lasts a lifetime. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given.What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. At least 50 percent of the population has been unprotected for decades.If we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95 percent. Yet we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50 percent or less of the population having vaccine protection.Herd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades, and no resurgent epidemics have occurred. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinations”.Where is the Logic?Take Pertussis (whooping cough) Dr. Palevsky explains this very well:Do children vaccinated with the pertussis vaccine somehow stop carrying pertussis bacteria in their airways simply because they’ve been vaccinated? NODo pertussis vaccines stop vaccinated children from transmitting the pertussis bacteria to other people? NODo pertussis bacteria disappear from society once vaccination rates are high? NO: Vaccination rates for pertussis have no impact on whether the pertussis bacteria are in the air or not, or whether or not we breathe them in. The presence of the pertussis bacteria, and the exposure to them, are in no way affected by vaccination status or vaccination rates.Do unvaccinated children, because they are unvaccinated, carry the bacteria in their airways, which vaccinated children are somehow no longer believed to be carrying because they’ve been vaccinated? NODo unvaccinated children transmit the pertussis bacteria to other children by the mere fact that they are not vaccinated? NO: Air is air. Air is free to breathe. We breathe in whatever is in the air. And, vaccinated and unvaccinated children are equally exposed to breathing in pertussis bacteria.Anyone who poses as science the idea that unvaccinated children pose a threat to the population because they are unvaccinated and are more likely to transmit a disease to the rest of the population, is misleading you, promulgating myth, and inaccurate. Vaccination with the pertussis vaccine does not exonerate anyone from carrying the pertussis bacteria, or prevent them from being exposed to the bacteria.Unvaccinated children do not walk around carrying secret viruses and bacteria that no-one else has. An unvaccinated child with measles has no greater chance of spreading measles than a vaccinated child with measles would.\n",

Thus preventing scientific progress and propagating pseudoscience. Science vs pseudoscience https://i.redd.it/04bewq91kxuy.jpgScientific progress always takes a long time. Even the now simple concept of hand washing took more than 20 years to catch on and Dr. Semmelweis was mocked and shamed for the notion that Drs may be spreading disease, suffered a nervous breakdown and died due to mistreatment in an asylum. This is how we reward people who question the status quo and seek progress, especially when it may bring to light that Drs may be unwittingly harming patients by following that status quo. Pro vaccine choice individuals are the ones calling for more study and scientific progress. It is usually the ones that call for more vaccination that have the hubris to believe the science is settled and we know everything there is to know about the human body and the immune system.  It is the ones against vaccine choice that have the arrogance to demand everyone follow what they believe regardless of the individuals hurt along the way. The belief that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and that the nation state should be allowed to tell an individual what to inject into their body are fascist ideals.Fascism - anti-intellectual, anti-democratic, individual interests are subordinated to the good of the nation, forcibly suppresses opposition and criticism, regiments industry, commerce, etc., emphasizes an aggressive nationalism and often racism. AKA taking away an individual’s right to choose what is injected into their body despite numerous side effects and subjecting them to mass experimentation for “the good of the nation” while really just backing the ever growing pharmaceutical industry and suppressing any information that contradicts their interests.

It doesn't mean 1: **AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccines are efficacious in preventing cases of influenza in children older than two years of age, but little evidence is available for children younger than two years of age.**No studies on this, doesn't make it less efficient. 2: **There was a difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, partly due to differing datasets, settings and viral circulation patterns.**Oh no, who would've thought, you moron, that strains cannot be matched every single year. Of course that a virus with increased mutagenic shifts will not be matched for the vaccine every year. Nobody claimed anything different. That doesn't make the vaccine itself harmful. What the fuck are you on about? Are you doing meth?As a former epidemiologist, I'm ashamed to read  Jefferson T's  \"review\" about the influenza vaccine. He uses SO FUCKING MANY fallacies. He doesn't take into account even the morbidity or mortality of the flu and claims that not even pregnant women should be vaccinated, because the less you do medical acts on them, the better. That's outrageous and bizarre as fuck. Do we live in 2019 or 1900?Do you even fucking know how flu pandemics wiped millions of people in 1919? Just look up Spanish flu.I'm sure those people would rather get a low antibody count from a vaccine, than fucking none. 40% less deaths is better than what happened then.https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/one-flu-into-the-cuckoos-nest/Read some more about how much of an imbecile JT is. You should feel as stupid as this guy is.>https://marshfieldresearch.org/News/clinic-researchers-study-finds-prior-flu-season-vaccines-may-provide-residual-protectionYou said that the flu shot is less and less efficient if you get it every year.Again, your reading comprehension is out of this world. And that's not good. Cause you don't seem to be having a human brain.They said:\"Researchers found adults had similar levels of protection if they received the flu vaccine in the current season, the previous season or both seasons. They also found that vaccine effectiveness was 27-41 percent higher for adults who were vaccinated for the first time in the past five years, compared to those who got the vaccine almost every year. She said reasons for the increase in effectiveness is not yet clear and more research is needed to understand how repeated flu vaccination affects the immune system.\"You know what that means, mister scientific method? That means THAT NO CORRELATION WAS FOUND.SO WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING HARD PROOF, WHERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE? I really hope you don't reproduce and just so you know, logical fallacies don't confirm your bullshit. Yes, science evolves. But vaccines are proof that science also works and it's better to prevent, unlike your claims that drs don't want that, than to treat. Or bury your patients. >AKA taking away an individual’s right to choose what is injected into their body despite numerous side effectsSide effects from inactivated vaccines are mild and rarely occurring. I guess you'd like to see people suffering from a disease instead of admitting that your lack of chemistry and physiology knowledge is null. Like your smooth brain. Fucking imbecile, next time you wanna copy paste shit to bother people with it, go into an infectious diseases ward and visit some intubated patients who are likely to die because of the flu./u/atheistbastard, get this troll outta here please.\n",

      "Mother is forcing me to go see \"VAXXED\" in theaters. What do I need to know? My mother is adamantly an anti-vaxxer and I've been in many discussions , most heated, about vaccines. I've learned not to challenge her on it because it's gotten me nowhere but she views my beliefs as a personal attack on her directly. She runs a supplements company and has traveled the world teaching about the dangers of vaccines and how it caused my youngest brother to get autism. It's actually the entire basis of why she's a Trump supporter because of his stance on the issue, but that's another issue entirely. I know the basis of the argument for vaccines (herd-immunity, diseases are worse etc) but our discussions always boil down to sources and generally what or who to believe. She has the assumption that all CDC sympathetic media or articles are in the pockets of big pharma so they can make all their profits through vaccines. I anticipate this being the crux of the argument following this movie. I don't believe I will break through to her but I do hope to get a better understanding of the issue before I go into 2 hours of full propaganda, then to be bombarded with questions. Here's a link of a bunch of articles she views as \"proof\" of what she believes:http://vaccinepapers.org/ I've gone through most of it and don't really know what to make of them. There's a lot of prefacing for the studies that are mentioned but like I said, I'm no expert. What do some of you make of these links and/or what valuable information can you give me before going to see \"VAXXED\"?Edit: So I went to see the movie and most of it isn't about what you think. Rather it's about the CDC coverup of the study that showed correlation between autism and the MMR. It's actually really compelling on that front and I urge those of you to go and watch it for yourselves and then come back to discuss what you saw. Don't just take my word for it.\n",

Whether it’s a YouTube video or a Facebook Page, etc. My thinking is that such groups simply become more and more influential through confirmation bias and thus promote more people towards dangerous actions. When you visit these groups the degree of critical thinking and criticism drops because every statement no matter how ridiculous reinforces the same misleading theme that vaccines are bad. So now the claims are not just vaccines cause autism, it’s vaccines cause cancer, diabetes, Down syndrome, depression, genetic mutations, and so forth. And yes I have read all these ridiculous claims made by anti-vaxxers. The evolving implied insanity is becoming that vaccines cause disease! My thought is that these anti-vaxxers do not deserve a social media platform to further nurture their growing ignorance. I encourage everyone to report all anti-vaxxers social media groups as ‘misleading’ and ‘potentials dangerous.’ Because there actions affect us, not just them!\n",

      "My anti-vax aunt just posted this comment on an article, much more cogently argued than most posts I see, and since I'm not knowledgeable enough to specifically refute anything I was wondering if one of you were. She's a little bit of a conspiracy nut and is super into homeopathy, but she also has a Ph.D. and has written books, so the usual idiocy isn't on display (at least rhetorically). If everything she claims in this post is true, then vaccines are the devil. I know that's not the case, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to refute most of her points, so I was wondering if any of you were.Here's the post:\"Contrary to the view that non-vaccinators are uneducated fools duped by conspiracy theories, most have taken the time to study the scientific data that show most vaccinations not to be worth the risk. Even the Supreme Court has deemed vaccination to be \"unavoidably unsafe\".Are you aware that, by law, the CDC sponsors a vaccine injury database called VAERS -- the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. According to VAERS data, over the past 10 years alone, 26,793 people have been hospitalized with vaccine injuries and 2,081 have died. Did you know that 162 young people, mostly healthy teenage girls, have now died after receiving the HPV vaccine?Did you know that, in exchange for granting legal immunity to vaccine manufacturers, the US government sponsors a vaccine court that awards compensation to families with vaccine-injured children? This court has paid out billions of dollars to families, including for children whose autism was deemed to have been caused by vaccination. Did you know that a 2005 FDA report on the Tripedia DTP vaccine listed many neurological problems as potential side effects, including autism?Did you know that one of the key studies that supposedly exonerated vaccines from causing autism was authored by Poul Thorsen, now a fugitive wanted for money laundering and fraud? And that, in contrast to what is constantly repeated in the media, there are dozens of studies implicating vaccines as playing a role in causing autism, as well as many other neurological and chronic diseases, including Type 1 diabetes (also on the rise in children)? Did you know that a 2011 study in Germany that compared vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations found unvaccinated children to be far more healthy, with much lower rates of asthma, allergies, ear infections, epilepsy, gluten sensitivities, GERD, anxiety and depression, autism, and dyslexia?Did you know that a growing number of physicians and immunologists are admitting that vaccination may not be worth the risk? They point out that, in an effort to avoid the childhood diseases (which only 60 years ago were considered beneficial because they triggered true immunity and spurts in child development), we may be causing an increase in chronic disease and a form of disease immunity that is not as strong and longlasting? Did you know that recent outbreaks of childhood diseases among vaccinated children is not due to their \"contamination\" by unvaccinated children or due to loss of so-called \"herd immunity\", but rather, is usually occurring in completely vaccinated populations because their artificial immunity is waning?Please understand. Parents who wish to forego vaccination for their children are not asking that others follow their lead. They simply want to be permitted to follow their beliefs and not be forced to administer these drugs to their children. Indeed, many of these families already have a vaccine-injured child. Each year, the extremely powerful vaccine industry sponsors media campaigns (like the one we are currently experiencing) whose ultimately goal is to force everyone to become their customers. As a society, we must preserve our human right not to be forceably injected and medicated against our will.\"\n",

I've learned not to challenge her on it because it's gotten me nowhere but she views my beliefs as a personal attack on her directly. She runs a supplements company and has traveled the world teaching about the dangers of vaccines and how it caused my youngest brother to get autism. It's actually the entire basis of why she's a Trump supporter because of his stance on the issue, but that's another issue entirely. I know the basis of the argument for vaccines (herd-immunity, diseases are worse etc) but our discussions always boil down to sources and generally what or who to believe. She has the assumption that all CDC sympathetic media or articles are in the pockets of big pharma so they can make all their profits through vaccines. I anticipate this being the crux of the argument following this movie. I don't believe I will break through to her but I do hope to get a better understanding of the issue before I go into 2 hours of full propaganda, then to be bombarded with questions. Here's a link of a bunch of articles she views as \"proof\" of what she believes:http://vaccinepapers.org/ I've gone through most of it and don't really know what to make of them. There's a lot of prefacing for the studies that are mentioned but like I said, I'm no expert. What do some of you make of these links and/or what valuable information can you give me before going to see \"VAXXED\"?Edit: So I went to see the movie and most of it isn't about what you think. Rather it's about the CDC coverup of the study that showed correlation between autism and the MMR. It's actually really compelling on that front and I urge those of you to go and watch it for yourselves and then come back to discuss what you saw. Don't just take my word for it.\n",

      "*SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN*, verified and established FACTS to immediately shut down the arguments of an uneducated anti-vaxxer. This post contains facts that will help you win any vaccine debate. This comprehensive and thorough list of facts will help you to counter and win any vaccine debate. If an antivaxer is attacking you or making baseless/outlandish + unscientific claims, you can use this list of information to shut their arguments down immediately with facts:\\-**Vaccines are extremely safe**: in fact, *no serious adverse events* (besides injection site pain/erythema) have ever actually been proven.\\-Vaccine adverse events are notoriously **OVER** (not under!) reported. It is estimated by a Harvard study using data mining technology + VAERS reports that **adverse events are reported at 100x** (or more) the **rate that they actually occur.**\\-One study found that **97% of \"adverse events\"** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects** (like the placebo effect, people believe/imagine they are having symptoms due to fear/expectation)\\-Not **a single case of autism** has ever made it to higher courts, because the **autism + vaccine connection has an overwhelming amount of research debunking it.**\\-in 1986, vaccine manufacturers took **on increased liability** for their product to reassure the public of safety: this is because research has proven without doubt that vaccines are **incredibly safe.** Despite manufacture liability, vaccine manufactures have never actually needed to pay out any amount for any purported \"injury\" claims. The evidence is overwhelming to **debunk these claims.**\\-**Andrew Wakefield,** a public disgrace and conspiracist theorist with multiple agendas, is the **only physician or scientist** to have **ever published a medical paper criticizing vaccine safety**. His paper was later **retracted for fraud** and his licence **revoked**.\\-**Vaccine inserts** list events that occur normally in populations and **do NOT prove any causative association** between vaccines and these purported \"events\". If the events listed in vaccine inserts actually \\*caused\\* these effects, billions in personal injury lawsuits would be paid out --> which is *not* the case!\\-Unlike what antivaxers claim, it has been proven thoroughly that Gardasil is incredibly safe. The supposed \"injuries\" that circulate the internet in the form of horror stories can be explained psychologically by the phenomenon of mass psychogenic events, instigated by fear + the nocebo effect.\\-The MMR does not cause any adverse neurological events or damage in the brains of laboratory animals, even at doses higher than used in humans.\\-The cumulative effect of the entire vaccination schedule (72 doses in children by the age of 18 today, in 2020) has been completely and thoroughly investigated for safety, and no issues have been found.\\-Vaccines have rigorous long-term safety studies for all potential of carcinogenicity, fertility, and long-term health adverse effects, and no issues have been found.\\-Despite some ethical concerns raised, several vaccinated vs. unvaccinated studies have been conducted. It was found that vaccinated children have significantly lower rates of allergies, chronic health problems, and neurological issues.\\-Vaccines are thought to have a potential neuroprotective and anti-cancer effect, which is still being studied. It is suspected that vaccines may prevent infertility, dementia, and cancer, although further investigation is needed.\\-All clinical trials for vaccines use double-blinded trials with saline placebos, which is the gold standard in medical research.\\-The FDA has an independent taxpayer-funded committee to examine and analyze all raw data from vaccine clinical trials. Scientists and data analysts conducting this research have extensive background testing to ensure no conflicts of interest in any pharmaceutical company. This debunks the myth of \"conflict of interest\" regarding vaccine manufacturers funding their own safety studies for FDA/CDC approval.\\-There are comprehensive laws to prevent the myth of the “revolving door” phenomenon that anti-vaxers like to use as proof of government-pharmaceutical corruption. If a scientist/researcher who investigated vaccine safety has had any financial ties to a pharmaceutical company, they are disqualified from the vaccine approval committee. Similarly, once an individual has worked in the field of vaccine approval for the FDA/CDC, they are unable to accept positions as pharmaceutical-hired scientists. These laws prevent conflicts of interest between vaccine approval and pharmaceutical profit.\\-Studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated infants have thoroughly refuted any claims linking vaccines to SIDS.\\-The USA has very high vaccination rates as well as one of the lowest rates of infant mortality in all developed nations.\\-France, which has a notoriously high rate of vaccine hesitancy, has higher rates of autism, SIDS, and chronic illnesses than other developed countries of similar socioeconomic structure.\\-Autism is “more prevalent” due to more advanced and specific diagnostic criteria. Once diagnostic criteria was established, people of older generations (age 50’s-80’s) were found to have nearly identical rates of autism to those of younger generations (age 40’s and under).**Source: CDC, WHO, and FDA.**If an antivaxer ever tries to argue with you about the safety of vaccines, this comprehensive list of facts will immediately shut down all their false claims and misunderstanding.

      "My parents got both doses of the Chinese covid vaccine but the Pfizer came out recently. Can they still take the Pfizer vaccine as well? If so, how much of a time gap should they keep My 67 year old father (65 kgs, has hypertension, type two diabetes) has been inoculated with the inactivated sinovac COVID-19 Vaccine (both doses). He is not overweight and exercises regularly. We had to get him inoculated due to the increasing virus transmission rate as well as the easy access to the Chinese sinovac vaccines in our country. However, recently out country introduced the Pfizer vaccine and opened up access to elderly people. I would like my dad to get vaccinated with Pfizer vaccine as well as I trust it more that the sinovac vaccine, due to the level of peer reviewed research published on the former candidate. Please advise on if he is able to take the Pfizer vaccine as well. If so, please advise how long of a gap should he keep between the last dose of the Sinovac vaccine and the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. P.S. After inoculation of the Sinovac vaccine, my father did not experience and adverse effects or experience any side effects.\n",

Our children, aged 10 and 12, are not vaccinated.I’m trying to get info from anti-vaxxers in order to prepare myself for an upcoming discussion/argument about whether or not to vaccinate our children as mandated by the state so that they can enroll in school. (as opposed to having her home-school them, or having her make good on her threats to move to another state with the kids if the current law is not repealed).My main question: the majority of anti-vaccine arguments I've read revolve around increased risks for infant autism, and around adverse reactions in children under 3 years old. I would like to know what are the main reasons put forth by the anti-vax community regarding keeping older children from getting vaccinated?\n",
